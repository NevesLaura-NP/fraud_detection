# Fraud Detection

This is a project based on historical transactions data from a bank. This will allow the creation of a minimal-viable-product that detects fraudulant payments.
Currently is not possible to import the data to github due to its datafile size limit. However jupiter notebooks will still be able to demonstrate the outputs of the analysed data, allowing the peer review of the code.

# EDA

Through an investigation of the data frame we could observe interesting visualizations. Once we chose the data that was classified as fraudulent and looked into the distribution of types of transactions we could see that they are limited to only two types: Cash Out and Transfer
